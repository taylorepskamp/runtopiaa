## About
This app draws inpiration from Strava's relative effort chart (a paid user feature). It relies on minutes recorded at various heartrate levels to establish a fitness score. These scores are then summed for a given week and graphed. Depending whether the average is above or below your trailing 4 week average, there is color coding and a message to help guide your fitness level.
